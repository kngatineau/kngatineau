#### Update - March 8th, 2024
Hi friends :wave: welcome to my GitHub. â€¨â€¨

You may notice that this GitHub is looking a little bare and outdated. When I was employed, I wasn't investing time on personal projects as I am a parent of a kiddo with exceptional needs and my time and brain bandwidth had reached max threshold. Itâ€™s a shame that my work GitHub activity doesnâ€™t magically transfer hereâ€” I have enough green squares to tile an entire bathroom ðŸ˜….

Unfortunately the company I invested days, nights and weekends for shut down without notice and I am now left with what is on my personal GitHub.. which doesn't accurately reflect where I am at now in my development journey. I am working on getting projects out to demonstrate the things I have learned over the last couple of years. 

In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out and ask me questions personally. ðŸ˜„

Happy coding!

Kaitlyn
